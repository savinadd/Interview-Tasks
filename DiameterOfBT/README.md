##Given a Binary Tree, find diameter of it.

The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree. The diagram below shows two trees each with diameter nine, the leaves that form the ends of a longest path are shaded (note that there is more than one path in each tree of length nine, but no path longer than nine nodes).



Input Format

This is a function problem. You need to complete the function diameter() that takes node as parameter and returns the diameter.

Constraints

1 <= Number of nodes <= 100
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000
Output Format

Return the diameter of the tree as an integer.
